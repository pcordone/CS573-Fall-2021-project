# Data Visualization Project CS573 Fall 2021 Peter Cordone

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is electrical usage data for multiple accounts for two years by month.  The dataset can be found here https://gist.github.com/pcordone/93039d5d909fbf42838c5167219d6ed4.

## Prototypes

Below is a screenshot of a scatter plot of the data for electrical usage for my personal accounts.  I live in an owner occupied 3 family and you can see the usage for two of the apartments that I occupy and the common meter which provides power for the rear and front LED lighting, basement outlets and outside outlets.  I have electric heat pumps that I use to cool in the summer and offset oil consumption in the winter.

(please put a screenshot of one or more visualizations of this dataset you already made, for previous assignments, and link to them)

You can make images into links like this:

Also, you can study the [source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/curran/dataviz-project-template-proposal/master/README.md) to figure out Markdown formatting. You can use the GitHub built-in editor to edit the document.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * (insert your question or task here) How does the X vary over time?
 * (insert your question or task here) Is there any correlation between X and Y?
 * (insert your question or task here) Are there interesting spatial patterns in X?
 * (insert your question or task here) How many X are there across different Y?

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)
