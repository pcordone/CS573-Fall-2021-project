# Data Visualization Project CS573 Fall 2021 Peter Cordone

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is electrical usage data for multiple accounts for two years by month.  The dataset can be found here https://gist.github.com/pcordone/93039d5d909fbf42838c5167219d6ed4.

## Prototypes

Below is a screenshot of a scatter plot of the data for electrical usage for my personal accounts.  I live in an owner occupied 3 family and you can see the usage for two of the apartments that I occupy and the common meter which provides power for the rear and front LED lighting, basement outlets and outside outlets.  I have electric heat pumps that I use to cool in the summer and offset oil consumption in the winter.

## Questions & Tasks

The visualization and interactions are intended to answer the following questions:

 * How does electricity usage vary over seasons of a year?
 * How does usage compare across two years for each month and season?
 * How does usage compare across accounts by season?
 * How has the cost of electricity change compared to usage (i.e. what effect has rate increases had)?
 * What does net metered usage (solar generated power) compare to total usage by account and by season?

## Sketches

This visualization sketch shows a bar graph wrapped around a circle representing the usage for the 12 months of the year.

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)
